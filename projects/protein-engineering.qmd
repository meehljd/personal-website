# Protein Engineering Project

Developed an ML-based pipeline for enzyme development using large language models (LLMs) and optimization algorithms.

## Overview

- **Objective**: Enhance enzyme functionality through predictive modeling and optimization.
- **Approach**:
  - Evaluated protein language models (PLMs) for functional prediction.
  - Analyzed zero-shot prediction methods comparing mutant and wild-type sequences.
  - Implemented Bayesian optimization and Gaussian processes.

## Results

- **Efficiency Gain**: Reduced discovery iterations by 2.2x.
- **Cost Savings**: Projected to save over $580,000 per discovery campaign.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: PyTorch, Scikit-learn, GPytorch
- **Methods**: Bayesian Optimization, Gaussian Processes, Machine Learning
