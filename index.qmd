Hey there! I'm Josh Meehl, a Data Scientist with a passion for where engineering meets science. I thrive on asking the "why" questions to understand systems, then putting on my engineering hat to scale solutions efficiently and reliably.

## What I Do

I specialize in data science and bioinformatics, applying cutting-edge data science techniques to solve complex problems in the biotech sector. My work ranges from predicting enzyme function with large language models to optimizing next-generation sequencing workflows using graph convolutional networks.

## My Approach

I love diving into the intersection of technology and life sciences. Whether it's developing ML pipelines for protein engineering or creating predictive models for oligo production, I'm always excited to leverage data to drive meaningful impact.

## Projects
Here's a quick reference to some of my recent projects:

- **[Protein Engineering Pipeline](projects/protein-engineering.qmd)**: Developed an ML-based pipeline for enzyme development using large language models (LLMs) and optimization algorithms.
- **[Simulated Annealing Optimization](projects/simulated-annealing.qmd)**: Applied simulated annealing algorithms to optimize the traveling salesperson problem with a whimsical twist.
- **[COVID-19 cDNA Clustering](projects/covid-seq-clustering.qmd)**: Analyzed and clustered cDNA sequences to understand mutation patterns in SARS-CoV-2.
- **Oligo Production Failure Prediction**: Enhanced predictive models for oligo production failures, leading to improved margins and reduced production failures.


## Outside Work

When I'm not immersed in bioinformatics, I channel my data science passion into a unique project: analyzing Magic: The Gathering (MTG) on my website [The Data Mage](https://mage.meehl.org). Here, I apply advanced data science and machine learning techniques to explore the intricacies of this complex card game. From predictive modeling of card interactions to optimizing deck-building strategies using ML algorithms, this project showcases how data-driven approaches can provide novel insights into recreational activities.

I'm always eager to learn and stay updated with the latest in tech and data science. Let's connect and explore how we can push the boundaries of what's possible with data!
