    "text": "One challenge with having little ones is finding kids’ music that doesn’t slowly drive you crazy. My family enjoys the kids’ albums by the nerd rock group They Might Be Giants (TMBG). Their song “Alphabet of Nations” is quite catchy.\nAt the same time my family was listening to the TMBG albums, I was also studying optimization and search heuristics. I was fascinated by the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and the various algorithms used to solve it.\nAnd so, in a moment of what I can only describe as sleep-deprived inspiration (parents, you know what I’m talking about), I decided to combine these two seemingly unrelated interests. The result? A project that uses the Simulated Annealing algorithm to solve a Traveling Salesperson Problem based on the nations mentioned in TMBG’s “Alphabet of Nations”. Because why not?"

Here’s our illustrious itinerary:\nAlgeria, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Dominica, Egypt, France, Gambia, Hungary, Iran, Japan, Kazakhstan, Libya, Mongolia, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Russia, Suriname, Turkey, Uruguay, Vietnam, Xylokeriza (Greece), Yemen, Zimbabwe\nYou might notice that “Xylokeriza, Greece” seems out of place. That’s because the song actually mentions “West Xylophone”, which, last I checked, isn’t a recognized nation. Since “xylophone” is of Greek origins, I substituted it with a real place in Greece that has “xylo” in the name. Creative problem-solving at its finest.\nFor those curious about the musical inspiration behind this madness, you can find the video here. Just don’t blame me if it gets stuck in your head."

    "text": "The Method to the Madness\nFor those interested in the technical details (and let’s face it, if you’ve read this far, you probably are), here’s how I put this together:\n\nFlight Data\nI repurposed some code from a previous project, the “Flight Deal Finder”, because why solve one problem when you can solve two? This code does the following:\n\nChoosing the busiest airport in each country.\nCreating a Google Sheet with these airports.\nUsing the Tiquila API via Kiwi.com to get flight prices, with some arbitrary rules to keep things interesting:\n\nCheapest one-way flights with up to 3 layovers\nFlight dates within 6 months of the query date\n\n\n\n\nOptimization\nThis is where the Simulated Annealing algorithm comes in. If you’re not familiar with it, imagine the process of forging a sword. Imagine heating metal to a high temperature so it becomes malleable, then slowly cooling it while hammering to remove imperfections. In simulated annealing, the “temperature” controls how freely the algorithm explores possible solutions, starting with random, wide exploration (high temperature) and gradually focusing on improving solutions (lower temperature). Just like how a blacksmith avoids cooling the metal too quickly to prevent cracks, the algorithm reduces randomness gradually to find an optimal solution without getting stuck in suboptimal ones. But here, instead of a sword, we have a travel itinerary. For the curious (or the insomniacs), there’s always the Wikipedia page.\nThe algorithm will randomly swap a pair of airports to change the route and compare the results to the previous route. If the new paths do not have available flights, the new route is rejected. If the new route is cheaper, it is kept. If the new route is more expensive, it is rejected with some probability of keeping it, based on the relative difference in the two routes’ performance, as well as the temperature parameter.\n\n\n\nTemperature Schedule\n\n\nThe algorithm going from hog-wild to tuckered-out"

This challenge is crucial in many areas of biotechnology, from developing new enzymes for industrial processes to creating better therapeutics.\nThe main obstacles in protein engineering are:\n\nThe high cost and time requirements of experimental testing. Ideally we can reduce the number of experiments needed to find the best protein variant. This also means we will typically have little or no functional data to start with.\nThe complex relationship between protein sequence and function. This is where LLM type models can really shine. We need to be able to predict a protein’s function given its sequence.\nThe vast search space of possible protein sequences. This is like finding a needle in a haystack the size of the universe. This is called the “combinatorial explosion” problem. We need to find the optimal protein variants in this massive fitness landscape.\n\nMy goal was to use machine learning to navigate this complex landscape more efficiently, reducing the time and resources needed to discover improved protein variants.\n The 3 main steps in my computational pipeline"

These models can make predictions about protein function without any experimental data.\nFew-shot Learning: Using the DMS experimental data, I trained various regression models (k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, random forests, and ridge regression) on embeddings from the PLMs.\nGaussian Processes: To balance exploration and exploitation in my search for superior variants, I implemented Gaussian Process models that provide both predictions and uncertainty estimates.\nBayesian Optimization: I used a simplified Bayesian optimization approach to efficiently search the protein fitness landscape, leveraging the uncertainties provided by the GP models."
